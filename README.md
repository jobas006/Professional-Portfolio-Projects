# A Repository that showcases all of the personal projects I've completed. The majority of my projects uses Jupyter in order to present each part of my scripts/codes in a simple fashion. I've done this in order to make the projects easier to interpret and understand. 

# Added a brief description for each project for users to get a main idea of the projects I've worked on. Hovering over the commits should display the descriptions.
