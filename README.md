# A Repository that showcases all of the personal projects I've completed. The majority of my projects use Jupyter to present each part of my scripts/codes in a simple fashion. I've done this to make the projects easier to interpret and understand. 

# Added a brief description of my projects so that users can get a quick, easy summary of them. Hovering over the commits should display the descriptions.
